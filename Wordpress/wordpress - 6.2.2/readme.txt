= What is Silktide? =

Silktide is a SaaS platform that helps organizations understand and improve their websites.

https://silktide.wistia.com/medias/y6emlp8zk6

Silktide eliminates the need for multiple quality checking tools, like free accessibility toolbars
or spell checkers, and creates a better workflow and experience for web teams in large organizations.

Silktide scans your websites and alerts you to issues with web accessibility, content quality, user
experience, marketing and SEO, and data privacy.

We’ll show you where the issues occur right on your page and suggest ways for you to fix them, all
in one simple to use yet powerful platform.

This plugin allows Silktide customers to link their WordPress-based websites and speeds up the process
of fixing issues we find.

With one click, you can get straight to the correct page in WordPress, make your fixes, and Silktide
immediately rescans your website.

Our clients include web and communications teams in Governments, Higher Education, Financial Institutions,
Healthcare, and Web agencies.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Silktide an accessibility overlay? =
No. Overlays (tools that suggest you can create an accessible website in one or two lines of code) are
incapable of giving you an accessible website. They leave you open to litigation and make for a much
poorer experience for people with disabilities.

The only way to create an accessible website is to fix the underlying code. Silktide identifies many
accessibility issues in your code, shows you where they are on each page, and explains in simple terms
how to fix them.

= How much does Silktide cost? =
[Request a demo](https://silktide.com/request-a-demo/) of Silktide, and we’ll prepare a custom quote
for your organization.

= Do I need to install any software to use Silktide? =
No. Silktide can scan all public websites without requiring you to install anything. This plugin in WordPress
is separate from the Silktide engine and simply allows you to navigate from Silktide to the exact page in
WordPress that requires an issue to be fixed.

= Can I use this plugin without being a Silktide customer? =
No, this plugin is designed specifically for Silktide customers whose websites are created in WordPress.
